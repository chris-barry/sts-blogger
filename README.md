Gets data from Blogger to make grading easier for professors who run blogs there.

## Setting Up Your Own

To run your own instance of this page, you will need three things:

1. A place to host the website.
2. A Blogger API token.
   TODO: Link to it.
3. A class that uses Google Blogger.

First you will want to clone this repository to the directory where it will be served from.
For this example, we will use `/srv/www/grader/`.
